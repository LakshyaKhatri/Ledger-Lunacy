**Subject:** Explanation of missing wire transaction

Dear Dr. Horrible,

I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to apologize for the confusion surrounding the missing wire transaction of $10k that you wired to Startup X.

Upon investigation, it has been found that the wire was received by the bank and was appearing in the bank's API. However, there was a bug in our code that filtered it out while we were trying to clean up the transaction history. As a result, the wire did not show up in your account.

We deeply regret that this went on for a week, and we wrongly assumed that you were not wiring the money. We regret to inform you that this resulted in the closure of the deal without your participation.

We understand that this must have caused a great deal of inconvenience to you and we would like to make it up to you. To start, we would like to offer you a full refund of the wire transaction and cover any fees incurred. Additionally, we would like to offer you a credit of $100 to be used towards any future transactions.

We have also taken steps to ensure that this issue does not occur again in the future, by thoroughly testing our code and implementing stricter quality control measures.

We understand that your trust in us has been shaken, and we would like to do everything in our power to regain it. If there is anything else that we can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,  
Lakshya Khatri  
Customer Support Team
