As the developer of the website, my first step in investigating this issue would be to gather as much information as possible from the customer. I would respond to Dr. Horrible's email and ask for more details about the wire transfer, including:

1. Date and time of the transfer
2. Amount of the transfer
3. Account number for the recipient
4. Any reference or confirmation numbers associated with the transfer

I would also ask if there were any error messages displayed during the wire transfer process or if the transfer showed as pending on the account statement.

Once I have this information, I would verify the status of the transfer with our back-end systems, such as the bank's wire transfer system and the customer's account records. If the transfer appears to have been completed successfully, I would then look into any potential processing delays that might have caused the funds to take longer to appear in the customer's account.

Next, I would check for any known issues with the website or any recent changes that may have impacted wire transfers. I would also look into any reports of similar issues from other customers.

One hypothesis could be that the wire transfer was not processed correctly due to a technical issue with the website. This could be falsified if the transfer appears to have been completed successfully in our back-end systems and there are no reported technical issues.

Another hypothesis could be that the wire transfer was sent to the incorrect recipient account number. This could be falsified by verifying that the recipient account number provided by the customer matches the account number on the transfer records.

It is important to prioritize the security of the customer's information and funds during this investigation, so I would take any necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality and protection of their data.
